```txt
I am a fallen man whom at my lowest hardly speak.
My lips take flight amongst the sky
and hardly take a seat.

"Come back o lips come back o lips for I can hardly fly"
I chased the lips with all my strength and yet it had outdone.
I lost control of my mouth-hole without an end in sight.

Finally, my mouth-hole had been run and started floating down.
I reached my hands and grabbed it there and did not let it go.
"O lips O lips for I ask about the things that you have done"

I looked upon my drat mouth hole
and wondered what it said.
For everytime it speaks its mind it tends to take a toll.

Tis the curse of wandering mouth I wish I never had.
A histrionic, a life of flaunting, sometimes I wish my death.
