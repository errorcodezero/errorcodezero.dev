Choosing a tech stack is honestly essential in a project. I wanted to build this site with good tools that would let me work fast and give a good experience. I want to present my tech stack.

# Astro

[Astro](https://astro.build/) is a great way to build blogs and portfolio sites. It is basically a static site generator with great support for tools like tailwind css, mdx, etc. 

# Vercel

[Vercel(Not Sponsored)](https://vercel.com) is what I use to host the site. I could use basically anything but I decided to use vercel since I already had a site on it.
